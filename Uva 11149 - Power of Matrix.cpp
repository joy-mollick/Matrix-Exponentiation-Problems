Think about our series F(n)=A + A^2 +A^3 +A^4 +A^5 + ......+ A^n.,where A is a given matrix.
So , F(n+1) = F(n) + A^(n+1) .Our relation becomes F(n) = F(n-1) + A^(n) .
So by expanding A^(n) we can build our matrix sketch like  M X B = A . 
But Notice that A is not a number so that we can't put A (as a number) in B matrix .
We will not be able to put the matrix A into another matrix (B) like matrix M X B = A .
So we have to find another way of relation so that we can do it efficiently .

Now think about a number series like    Solve(n)=x + x^2 +x^3......+ x^n , where x is a number 

Here relation can be build recursively like  Solve(n) = ( 1 + x^(n/2) ) * Solve(n/2) . when n is even .Do it by your hand and check .

                                             Solve(n) = ( 1 + x^(n/2) ) *( Solve(n/2) + x^n . when n is odd .
                                                                           
                                                        ----------------------------- +-----
                                             Solve(n)   Solve(n-1)                    + x^n . [ as (n-1)/2 and (n)/2 is same for any odd number (n) that's why for odd n we have to extra x^n to come up with a solution .
                                                                          
    Now we can build our solution of Exact problem equivalently below 
    
                                             Solve(n) = ( I + A^(n/2) ) * Solve(n/2) . when n is even  .

                                             Solve(n) = ( I + A^(n/2) ) *( Solve(n/2) + A^n . when n is odd .
                                                                           
                                                        ----------------------------- +-----
                                             Solve(n)   Solve(n-1)                    + A^n .
                                                                          
    I stated for identity matrix (filled up all diagonals with 1 ) which is equivalent to 1 ,I works as like as (one)1 all time in calculation of matrix . and A is equivalent to our x . 
    We can find A^n and A^(n/2) by using our previous power function of matrix . we have to write another function add for adding I to A^(n/2) . So now we can do it recursively .                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
According to question constraints .

if(k%2==0)
 A+A^2+A^3+.....+A^k = (I+A^(k/2))*(A+A^2+....+A^k/2)
                                                                          
 else
    A+A^2+A^3+.....+A^k = (I+A^(k/2))*(A+A^2+....+A^k/2) + (A^k)
